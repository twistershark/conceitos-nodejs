# NodeJS Concepts (CRUD)

Simple Node project to practice the concepts of a CRUD in NodeJS. The idea of this project is to store GitHub repositories.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Node: version 12 or higher
Yarn: version 1

### Installing

After you clone this repository, enter the repository folder and run on the terminal:
```
yarn
```

After that, you may be able to start the server using:

```
yarn dev
```

## Running the tests

If you want to test any implementation, you should be able to run:

```
yarn test
```

### Break down into end to end tests

The tests are going to verify if it's possible to create, update, list and delete the repositories and if it's possible to give a like to a certain repository.
